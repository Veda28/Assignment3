<p class="Big">One of the most wondrous and iconic animals to walk the Earth, Bengal tigers are majestic and rare. Theyâ€™re also one of the biggest cat species in the world. On average, Bengals are larger than other tiger species, but the largest tiger ever recorded was a Siberian. As such, Bengals are considered the second largest tiger species.Today, wild Bengal tigers are animals that only live in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. And while there are more Bengals than any other tiger subspecies on the Indian subcontinent, the populations are endangered.</p>
