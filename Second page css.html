<h2><i>Aster</i></h2>
<p class="ad" >
Most of these beautiful perennials are native to Eurasia, with only two from North America — the New York and New England asters. Their one-inch flowers are starbursts of closely packed, narrow petals in intense blue, purple, lilac, pink, or white. They brighten a garden in late summer through fall and are great for attracting butterflies, bees, and other pollinators. The word “aster” means star in Greek, and it sparkles as the September birthday flower and also for a 20th wedding anniversary. </p>
<h2><i>Black-Eyed Susans</i></h2>
<p class="sd">
Cheerful black-eyed Susans are one of North America’s favorite perennial wildflowers that are frequently seen in fields and meadows. They are a popular addition to a sunny garden since they are hardy, they can tolerate drought and a variety of soils, and they can reseed and come back year after year. Black-eyed Susans are perfect for a beginner gardener. Their jolly orange petals and brown centers represent encouragement and can be given to a friend who could use a bouquet of optimism. </p>
<h2><i>California Poppy</i></h2>
<p class="ad">
Also known as the golden poppy, this bright red, orange, or yellow native plant is the state flower of California. It is either an annual or a perennial depending on the climate — annual in colder areas and perennial in warmer regions. The California poppy is a sun worshipper that opens its petals in the sun and closes them on cloudy days and at night. Native Americans used preparations of the plant to relieve anxiety and for various kinds of pain, but unlike its cousin the opium poppy, it does not contain any opiates. </p>
